# 1) Ask Phase of Data Analysis : What do we need to know?
​
For effective results we need to ask the following questions and aim for their answers throughout our analysis:
​
​
1. What are some trends in smart device usage in non-Bellabeat customers?
2. How can these trends apply to Bellabeat customers for one of its product?
3. How can these trends help guide Bellabeat marketing strategy?

# 2) Prepare Phase of Data Analysis : What is our Data?

**Data Source:** 
[FitBit Fitness Tracker dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit?datasetId=1041311&sortBy=voteCount)




**Data Collection:** 

**What?:** This Kaggle public data set contains personal fitness tracker data from thirty **FitBit** users, including minute-level data for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

**Who?:** The dataset was collected by *Amazon Mechanical Turk* from consenting FitBit users in their survey.

**Why?:** The data was to collected with an inspiration to understand Human temporal routine behavior and pattern recognition.




**Data Brief:**
The dataset contains 18 tables linked via the user IDs and timestamps. These tables contain information pertaining to the various intensities of physical activity,sedantary periods, calories burned (measured on daily basis, hourly basis and minute-wise basis)sleep duration(daily and minute-wise) and its frequency, weight logs, as well as heartrate.




**Data Limitations:**

* The data has been collected between 12-Mar-2016 and 12-May-2016. This makes it outdated for use in 2022.
* The sample size is of around 33 participants for most of the parameters and lesser for parmeters like heart rate per second (7) and weight (8). It is not sufficient to establish a good confidence level.
* The data set does not provide any demographic information pertaining to the participants which makes it difficult to analyse the data with respect to Bellabeat's target of female customers.
