2) Prepare Phase of Data Analysis : What is our Data?
Data Source: FitBit Fitness Tracker dataset

Data Collection:

What?: This Kaggle public data set contains personal fitness tracker data from thirty FitBit users, including minute-level data for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

Who?: The dataset was collected by Amazon Mechanical Turk from consenting FitBit users in their survey.

Why?: The data was to collected with an inspiration to understand Human temporal routine behavior and pattern recognition.

Data Brief: The dataset contains 18 tables linked via the user IDs and timestamps. These tables contain information pertaining to the various intensities of physical activity,sedantary periods, calories burned (measured on daily basis, hourly basis and minute-wise basis)sleep duration(daily and minute-wise) and its frequency, weight logs, as well as heartrate.

Data Limitations:

The data has been collected between 12-Mar-2016 and 12-May-2016. This makes it outdated for use in 2022.
The sample size is of around 33 participants for most of the parameters and lesser for parmeters like heart rate per second (7) and weight (8). It is not sufficient to establish a good confidence level.
The data set does not provide any demographic information pertaining to the participants which makes it difficult to analyse the data with respect to Bellabeat's target of female customers.

3) Process Phase of Data Analysis: Is our Data clean and ready for Analysis?
For ensuring that each table is tidy we need to perform the following:

Ensure the naming consistancy
Check and Remove duplicates
Make consistant date formats
Store time and date in different columns

Ensuring that the individual distances sums up to the total distance

mutate(new_sum= light_active_distance+moderately_active_distance+very_active_distance)%>%
subset(select=c(id, total_distance,new_sum, light_active_distance,moderately_active_distance,very_active_distance))
head(l)
add Codeadd Markdown
As evident from above:

the sum of induvidual distances(light_active_distance,moderately_active_distance,very_active_distance) does not add upto the total distance specified. This makes any analysis based upon the sum of these vaues incorrect. Hence we will not use the sum of these value in any part of our analysis.
Another noticable fact is that the most users are majorly lightly active throughout the total distance they cover. Hence, the need to promote some high intensity activites, so that the users may see evident changes.

Now we will be merging the cleaned daily_activity and daily_sleep tables for ease of analysis and visualisation

#merging daily_activity and new_sleep tables on date, day and userIDs.
#Since daily activity table has more number of participants we will use"all.x=TRUE" 
#to ensure that all the non-matching cases of x are appended to the result as well.

daily<- merge(daily_activity, new_sleep, by= c("id", "date", "day"), all.x= TRUE)
daily<- distinct(daily)

4) Analyse Phase of data analysis: What trends does our data reveal?

Summary statistics of all our tables: To get brief insights of our data
add Codeadd Markdown
# daily table

summary(select(daily, total_steps, total_distance, sedentary_minutes, calories, total_minutes_asleep, total_time_in_bed,   total_time_awake_in_bed
))
add Codeadd Markdown
# hourly_intensity table
 summary(select(hourly_intensity, total_intensity))
add Codeadd Markdown
From the above we can note that:

The mean of total_steps for about 34 participants is below 8,000 which is not sufficient to see maximum health benefits. This shows that most users of fitness devices would require some motivation to increase their activity levels.
The mean sedantry minutes are a staggering 991.2 minutes (16.5 hours). This metric gives us the insight that most fitness device users are likely to be people who have long sitting hours and do a desk job- a great idea of target group for bellabeat marketing.
The analysis shows that an average participant remains awake in bed for 21-30 minutes, before they are finally able to sleep.
The mean Intensity per hour for the participants was merely 12 minutes.

There are days for each participant when no information has been collected. Let us find out the total number of days for each participant when the data was collected.

add Codeadd Markdown
days<- daily%>%
group_by(id)%>%
summarise(number_of_days_info_collected= n_distinct(date))%>%
arrange(number_of_days_info_collected)
add Codeadd Markdown
days
add Codeadd Markdown
As we see,** information was not collected for all the participants on all the days**. Why did the device did not collect information on few days? was the device not used on said dates? or perhaps the participants were involved in other activites like jump rope, swimming, bicycling etc that the device could not register?

Finding out the target audience

We can do this by analysing either the steps taken, the calories burned or the very_active_minutes against the days of the week.

# by Calories burned
ta_calories<-daily%>%
group_by(day)%>%
summarise(sum_calories= sum(calories) )

# By very_active_minutes

group_by(day)%>%
summarise(sum_very_active_mins= sum(very_active_minutes) )
ta_sum_very_active_mins
add Codeadd Markdown
# Plotting the results down for better understanding, with geom_histogram and some fancy esthetics
ggplot(daily,mapping=aes(x=day, weight=very_active_minutes, fill=day))+geom_histogram(stat="count", colour="white", alpha=0.4)+labs(y="sum_very_active_minutes")+theme(panel.background=element_blank(), axis.line=element_line(colour="black"))
add Codeadd Markdown
Let us confirm our analysis once, with similar calculations and plotting for total_steps taken on each day

add Codeadd Markdown
# By total_steps taken on each day
ta_sum_steps<- daily%>%
group_by(day)%>%
summarise(sum_steps= sum(total_steps))
ta_sum_steps
add Codeadd Markdown
# Plotting the results with  geom_col 
​
plot<-ggplot(ta_sum_steps, mapping=aes(x= day, y=sum_steps, fill=day))+geom_col(colour="white", alpha= 0.4)
plot+theme(panel.background=element_blank(), axis.line=element_line(colour="black"))
add Codeadd Markdown
from the above we achieve that:

The most active days for participants are Tuesdays and Wednesdays
The least active day for participants are Sundays followed by Fridays
So the target audience for Bellabeat is one that most likely:

aims to relax and rest on the beginning and end of weekends(Fridays and Sundays) but
follows a routine and remains active throughout the workdays(mon-thursdays) ,
while being most energetic and active during the mid-week period(Tuesdays and Wednesdays)

add Codeadd Markdown
From the above we can note that:

The most active Time period for participants is around 5pm to 7pm
The least active timeframe for the participants is obviously the early morning hours of 2am to 4am
So the target audience for Bellabeat is one that is most likely:

full time workers who focus on their physical health after work hours are finished (5pm to 7pm)

add Codeadd Markdown
The above analysis shows a slightly positive relation between increase in daily number of steps and calories burned i.e with every increase in the number of steps, the calories burned increases.

This information can be used to market features that involve setting and attaining goals to burn more calories by increasing the daily steps.

theme(panel.background=element_blank(), axis.line=element_line(colour="black"))
add Codeadd Markdown
The analysis is depicting slightly negative correlation between energy expenditure throughout the day and sleeplessness while in bed. This means that an increased period of activity is associated with less time spend in bed before finally sleeping.

add Codeadd Markdown
Let us also analyse the relationship between sedantry minutes and sleep duration

add Codeadd Markdown
cor(x=daily_without_na$total_minutes_asleep, y=daily_without_na$sedentary_minutes, method="pearson")
add Codeadd Markdown
#plotting the same
ggplot(daily_without_na, mapping=aes(total_minutes_asleep, sedentary_minutes))+geom_point(colour="purple")+facet_wrap(~total_sleep_records) +geom_smooth(colour="orange")+
theme(panel.background=element_blank(), axis.line=element_line(colour="black"))
add Codeadd Markdown
As seen in both of the above analysis:

Having increased activity throughout the day is related to less awake time before sleeping.
Likewise increased periods of inactivty(sedantry minutes) is associted with poor amount of sleep.
These insights can be used to market the Bellabeat for saliant feature of improved sleep with regular physical activity.
